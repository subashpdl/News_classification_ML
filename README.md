# news_classification
Serveral machine learning algorithms are being used in this project. The goal of this project is to classify the news paper based on the content of news.

The 20 newsgroups dataset is a popular choice in the fields of Natural Language Processing (NLP). It consists of around 20000 newsgroup documents on
20 different newsgroups. The dataset can be accessed on various websites such as
kaggle or even directly fetched with a dedicated function of the popular Python
library scikit-learn, whereby the latter is the chosen option to load the data in
the following work.
The data itself is organized into 20 newsgroups which correspond to different
topics each. The topics are not necessarily related to each other, some of them are
related, e.g. comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware / comp.sys.mac.hardware, while
others are not, e.g misc.forsale / soc.religion.christian
